      # For this section, HTML elements are used instead of Markdown. This is because the "details" HTML element, which provides a collapsible feature, doesn't support Markdown properly within it. Additionally, there is no equivalent feature to this "details" element in GitHub Flavored Markdown. To ensure consistency and convenience, the entire section is written in HTML. This approach avoids mixing a small amount of Markdown with a predominantly HTML structure, which is mainly within the "details" elements. Since CSS cannot be used here, some GitHub styled HTML elements were used for styling purposes alone. The HTML was written and tested within HTML and Markdown files, then pasted here.
