      # For this section, HTML elements are used instead of Markdown. This is because the "details" HTML element, which provides a collapsible feature, doesn't support Markdown properly within it. Additionally, there is no equivalent feature to this "details" element in GitHub Flavored Markdown. To ensure consistency and convenience, the entire section is written in HTML. This approach avoids mixing a small amount of Markdown with a predominantly HTML structure, which is mainly within the "details" elements. Since CSS cannot be used here, some GitHub styled HTML elements were used for styling purposes alone. The HTML was written and tested within HTML and Markdown files, then pasted here.

        A list of constraints of the Epic. This includes the triple constraint (scope, timeline, budget) along with any other constraints of the Epic. The constraints commonly associated with software development projects are implied. If any other constraints beyond what's ordinarily expected are identified, they should be stated here.

          - Timeline: The estimated start and end dates (duration) of the Epic. This is based on the planned sprints (milestones) for the child issues (Stories and Tasks) linked to this Epic. The start date is the start date of the child issue with the earliest sprint, while the end date is the end date of the child issue with the latest sprint.
          - Budget: The estimated budget for the Epic.
