# Default Community Heath Files

This repository contains the default community health files for all of the GitHub repositories that I own. These files include issue templates/forms, a pull request template, and a contributing guide. For more information about these files, visit GitHub's [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file).

## Reusability

These default community health files are designed to be reused across my repositories, should they not require custom files due to unique needs. These default files reflect my subjective approach to repository management, which is based on my research and experience. As this repository is public, I have omitted my personal details from these files so that they can be reused in repositories owned by other individuals and organizations, should they wish to use my approach to repository management.

## Contents

The following are the default community health files included in this repository.

1. [**Issue Templates/Forms**](https://github.com/antonio-crispino/.github/issues/new/choose): Issue templates/forms help customize and standardize the information that contributors include when they report issues in a repository. For more details, refer to this GitHub [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/about-issue-and-pull-request-templates). Five issue forms are provided to support agile software development, yet their [configuration](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml "config.yml") does not restrict collaborators from opening blank issues. Information about these issue forms can be found in the [contributing](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#1---issues "CONTRIBUTING.md") file. The following is the list of issue forms:

   1. [**Epic**](https://github.com/antonio-crispino/.github/issues/new/choose)
   2. [**Story**](https://github.com/antonio-crispino/.github/issues/new/choose)
   3. [**Task**](https://github.com/antonio-crispino/.github/issues/new/choose)
   4. [**Bug**](https://github.com/antonio-crispino/.github/issues/new/choose)
   5. [**Subtask**](https://github.com/antonio-crispino/.github/issues/new/choose)

2. [**Pull Request Template**](.github/pull_request_template.md "pull_request_template.md"): A pull request template ensures that contributors provide consistent and desired information when they submit pull requests to a repository. For more details, refer to this GitHub [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/about-issue-and-pull-request-templates).

3. [**Contributing Guide**](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md "CONTRIBUTING.md"): The CONTRIBUTING.md file outlines the guidelines for contributing to a repository. For more details, refer to this GitHub [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors).

While there are other default community health files that could be added to this repository, I have only created the ones currently necessary for my needs. Others may be added in the future as a need for them arises.
